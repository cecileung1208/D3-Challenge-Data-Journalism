## Background

The goal of this project is to use the US Census Bureau Health dataset provided to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.  The current data set includes demographics factors such as age, income and poverty and health risks such as healthcare, obesity and smoking rates.

## Requirements

Create a scatter plot graph with state abbreviation in the circles for the following:

1.  Health Care vs. Poverty
2.  Interactive Multiaxis Graph for Health Risk Factors (Health Care, Smoking, Obesity) vs. Demographic Factors (Poverty, Age, Household Income)

## Datasets

[US Census Bureau Health dataset](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Journalism-Data-Analysis/tree/main/D3_data_journalism/assets/data) - https://data.census.gov/cedsci/

## Method

* Import the data from the CSV file.
* Set the locations and ranges for the x and y axes.
* Plot the x and y axes.
* Set the coordinates and dimensions for the circles representing the data for each state.
* Plot the circles representing the data for each state.
* Add a text label of each state's abbreviation within the appropriate circle for identification purposes.
* Add a tool tip to indicate demographics and health risk information.
* Create html files and link the JavaScript files.

## Scripts
